# For Frank

This was written some time ago (11-14-2014) based on a talk about timings on the Arduino Unos. If I remember correctly - The project was to blink a LED, play a sound (in this case a song), 
and turn on a different LED if a button was pushed.
The project page can be found here:

This is a good demo of using a intrupt on a UNO. It could be tweaked, but works pretty good.
